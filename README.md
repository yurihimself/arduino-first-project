# My First Arduino Project

This is my first Arduino project.  
It makes three LEDs blink in a pattern.  

**Parts used:**
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper wires / breadboard
- USB Cable
- 3 LED
- 3 × 220 Ohm Resistors

**Notes:**
- I followed a YouTube tutorial for the code.
- The goal was to learn how to upload code to an Arduino and control LEDs.
